ArachnidJS
==========

Javascript version of the well known Arachnid game

The development follows the following rules:
- no install ; the game is entirely contained in a single .html file (including images, css and js code)
- no dependencies
- no sound
- ability to play not connected to INTERNET
- stick as much as possible to the original arachnid.exe (windows 3.1) game
- however, add some nice options

To play:

08/09/2017 the game is finished.
Known issues:
- Restoring saved games by drag'n drop, could be better
- bug: "touch screen" on android/chrome taken twice
