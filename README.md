ArachnidJS
==========

Javascript version of the well known Arachnid game

The development follows the following rules
- no install ; the game is entirely contained in a single .html file (including images, css and js code)
- no dependencies
- ability to play not connected to INTERNET
- stick as much as possible to the original arachnid.exe (windows 3.1) game
- however, add some nice options

11/07/2017 the game is playable. Missing : undo
